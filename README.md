# Delivery Platform – Neural Networks Regression
This study focuses on applying Neural Network based Regression techniques to predict order demand for a delivery platform.

## Business Objective

To predict order demand for a delivery platform using neural network–based regression models in order to improve operational planning and resource allocation.

## Problem Statement

Demand for delivery varies significantly across time and locations. Traditional regression models struggle to capture these non-linear patterns. The company aims to:

-    Accurately forecast order demand

-    Capture complex relationships between demand and influencing factors

-    Improve delivery partner allocation and service efficiency

## Methodology

-    Exploratory Data Analysis of Demand Patterns

-    Data Preprocessing and Feature Scaling

-    Baseline Regression Modeling

-    Neural Network Regression Model Development

-    Model Evaluation and Performance Comparison

## Key Insights

-    Demand exhibits strong temporal and spatial non-linearity

-    Neural networks outperform linear regression models

-    Feature scaling significantly impacts neural network performance

## Business Impact

-    Accurate demand forecasting supports:

-    Efficient delivery partner allocation

-    Reduced order delays during peak periods

-    Improved customer experience and operational efficiency
